I am a Senior Data Engineer at Amazon with more than 11+ years of experience.  
Here are 5 pieces of advice I would give to people in their 20s, who want to make a career in Big Data in 2025:  
  
◄ Stop obsessing over fancy tools [ Master SQL first ]  
- Become fluent at writing complex joins, window functions, and optimizing queries.  
  
- Deeply understand ETL pipelines: know exactly how data moves, transforms, and lands in your warehouse.  
  
- Practice schema design by modeling real datasets (think e-commerce or user analytics data).  
  
◄ Get hands-on with cloud, not just theory  
- Don't just pass AWS certification exams, build projects like a data pipeline from S3 to Redshift or an automated ETL workflow using AWS Glue.  
  
- Learn Kafka by setting up a simple real-time data streaming pipeline yourself.  
Set up an end-to-end analytics stack: ingest real-time data, process it with Airflow, Kafka, and visualize with QuickSight or Power BI.  
  
◄ System Design is your secret weapon  
- Don't memorize patterns blindly, sketch systems like a Netflix-like pipeline, complete with partitioning and indexing choices.  
  
- Practice explaining your design to someone non-technical, if you can’t, redesign it simpler.  
  
- Understand real trade-offs like when to pick NoSQL (DynamoDB) vs SQL (Postgres) clearly, with real-world reasons (transaction speed vs consistency).  
  
◄ Machine learning isn't optional anymore  
- Go beyond theory: integrate real ML models into your pipelines using something like Databricks or SageMaker.  
  
- Experiment with ML-based anomaly detection, build a basic fraud detection pipeline using real public datasets.  
  
- Know basics of Feature Engineering, prepare datasets used by data scientists, don’t wait for them to teach you.  
  
◄ Soft skills will accelerate your career  
- Learn to clearly communicate business impact, not just tech specs. Don’t say "latency reduced," say “users see pages load 2x faster.”  
  
- Document like your future self depends on it, clearly explain your pipelines, edge cases, and design decisions.  
  
- Speak up early in meetings, your solutions won’t matter if no one understands them or knows you created them
