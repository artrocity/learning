## Where Does Data Live?
- Emails
- Databases
- User's desktops
- External Services

## How Should We Obtain the Data
- Standardized - If storing inside of a Data Warehouse
- Consistent - Brings trust to the engineer from the stakeholders
- Processes Need to Fail Loudly - When something goes wrong it needs to fail loudly so the engineer can hear about it prior to the stakeholders
	- If processes stop that are connected to other processes, stop the other processes
	- This will prevent other processes from becoming corrupted 

## Places to store data
