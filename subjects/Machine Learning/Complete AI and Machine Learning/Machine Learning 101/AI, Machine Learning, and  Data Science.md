## AI
- The act of solving problems which would normally require human intelligence

## Machine Learning
- A subset of AI, which is the science of getting computers to act without being programmed

## Machine Learning vs Computer Programming
- If a problem has a set of rules that are clearly defined, it should be created via programs, not machine learning
- For abstract ideas that can't easily be programmed, we should use machine learning such as:
	- Analyze this picture and tell me what it is
	- Analyze this text document and summarize it for me

## Deep Learning / Neural Networks
- Subset of machine learning that focuses on utilizing neural networks to perform tasks such as classification, regression, and representation learning

## Data Science 
- Field of science that uses statistics, algorithms, and technology to extract insights from data
