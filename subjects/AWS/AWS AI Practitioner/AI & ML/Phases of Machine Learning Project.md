	- Data scientists, data engineers, and ML architects/engineers collaborate
- Data Collection & Preparation
	- Collect data and convert to usable format
	- Make data centrally accessible
	- Pre-process data and prepare visualization
- Feature Engineering
	- Feature engineering: create, transform, and extract variables from the data
- Model Training & Parameter Tuning
	- Model training, tuning
- Model Evaluation
	- Evaluate the model
	- Determine if additional features are required or if more tuning is required
- Are business goals met
	- No
		- Do we require more data
		- Data Augmentation
	- Yes
		- Model Testing & Deployment
		- Monitor & Debuf
