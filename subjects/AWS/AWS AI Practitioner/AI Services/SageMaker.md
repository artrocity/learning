## What is it??
- Fully managed service for machine learners and data scientists to build ML models
- SageMaker allows one place for all of your needs which is typically difficult to do all the processes in one place
- Used to:
	- Collect and prepare data
	- Build and train machine learning models
	- Deploy the models and monitor the performance of the predictions
- Built in Algorithms
	- Supervised
		- KNN
		- Linear regressions and classifications
	- Unsupervised
		- K-means
		- Anomaly Detection
	- Textual Algorithms
		- NLP
	- Image Processing
- Automatic Model Tuning
	- Define the object metric that you want to optimize for
	- AMT automatically chooses the hyperparameter ranges, runtime, tuning job
	- Helps you not waste time and money
- Model Deployment
	- Deploy with one click
	- Automatic scaling
	- No servers
	- Managed solution - no overhead
