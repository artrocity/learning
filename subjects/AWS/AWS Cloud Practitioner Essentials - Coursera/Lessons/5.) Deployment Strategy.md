Deployment Strategy Types

- Cloud-based
    
    - In a cloud-based deployment model, you can build applications on a low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them or you can build it using higher level services that reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements
    - Runs all parts of the application in the cloud
    - Migrate existing applications to the cloud
    - Design and build new applications in the cloud
- On-premises based
    
    - Deploy resources by using virtualization
    - Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies
    - On-premises deployment is also known as private cloud deployment. Resources are deployed on-premises by using virtualization and resource management
- Hybrid
    
    - Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure
    - Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications
    - Hybrid deployment can benefit companies that require legacy applications that are better suited to on-premises management or government regulations
