AWS Global Infrastructure

- To provide high availability and fault tolerance, AWS has data centers all throughout the world
 
Business Decisions to choose a region

- Compliance
    
    - Is there any compliance issues or reasons that your data is required to be geographically located within a certain region
- Proximity
    
    - How close are you to your customer base
    - Where are the majority of your users located
    - The speed of light still affects (via latency) the ability to access information
- Feature Availability
    
    - Does the region you desire have all the features you require
    - As new features become available, it takes time for AWS to implement those features into all regions
- Pricing
    
    - Some locations are more expensive to operate in compared to other regions
    - Due to country tax legislation, some countries are more expensive for AWS to operate in causing the user to have an increased operating cost
 
Regions

- Regions are divided up into separate parts of the world
- Regions are comprised of multiple data centers within each region
- Regions are connected to other regions via a high speed fiber network controlled by AWS
- Regions provide a global network architecture
 
Availability Zones

- An availability zone is a singular data center or a group of close data centers
- It's recommended to run a single application across two availability zones within an Availability Zone
- Availability zones are located tens of miles apart from each other.
