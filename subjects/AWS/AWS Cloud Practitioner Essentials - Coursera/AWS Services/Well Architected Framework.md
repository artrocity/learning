AWS Well-Architected Framework

- Helps users understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud
- Allows you to measure your architecture against best practices and design principles
- Operates on 6 pillars to help assist in designing a well architected cloud platform
    
    - Operational Excellence
        
        - Ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and improve processes and procedures
        - Design principles include
            
            - Performing operations as code
            - Annotating Documentation
            - Anticipating Failure
            - Frequent, small reversible changes
    - Security
        
        - Ability to protect information, systems, and assets through risk assessments and mitigation strategies
        - Apply the best practices
            
            - Automate security whenever possible
            - Apply security at all layers
            - Protect data in transit and at rest
    - Reliability
        
        - Ability of a system to:
            
            - Recover disruptions and outages
            - Scale, Dynamically acquire computing resources
            - Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
    - Performance Efficiency
        
        - Ability to use computing resources to efficiently meet system requirements and to maintain efficiency as demand changes
        - Apply best practices
            
            - Experiment Often
            - Use Serverless Architectures
            - Design systems to be global in minutes
    - Cost Optimization
        
        - Ability to run systems to deliver value at the lowest price points
        - Best practices
            
            - Adoption a consumption model
            - Analyze and Attribute expenditure
            - Use managed services to reduce the cost of ownership
    - Sustainability
        
        - Ability to continually improve sustainability by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload
        - Best practices
            
            - Understand your impact
            - Establish sustainability goals
            - Maximize utilization
            - Anticipate and adopt efficient hardware and software settings
            - Use Managed services
