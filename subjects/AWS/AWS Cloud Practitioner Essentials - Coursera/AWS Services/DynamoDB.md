AWS DynamoDB

- Serverless, Non-Relational, No-SQL, Key-Value Database
- Purpose Built
- Fully Managed and Highly Scalable
- Millisecond Response Time
- Non-Relational Database
    
    - Simple, Flexible Schemas
- Items in the tables do not need to have the same attributes
- Queries are ran on a small subset of keys
    
    - Queries are simple
- Tables are created that store items
- Items / Attributes
    
    - Data is organized in Items and Attributes which are stored in tables
- Data is stored redundantly across multiple Availability Zones
- It does not use SQL, Schemas, or Relational Data
- If data is less rigid and requires fast availability, DynamoDB is viable
