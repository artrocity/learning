Amazon Simple Storage Service

- AWS S3 allows you to store and retrieve an almost unlimited amount of data
- Data is stored as an object
    
    - Each object consists of:
        
        - Data
        - Metadata
        - Key
    - The data might be a video, image, text document, or any other type of file
    - Metadata contains information about what the data is, how it was used, the object size, and so on
    - An object's key is it's unique identifier
    - In block storage only the item changes is updated, in object storage, the entire object is updated
- Objects are stored in buckets
    
    - Think of a file in your hard drive - that's an object
    - Think of a file directory - that's a bucket
- Maximum object size is 5 TB
- Objects can maintain version control
- Can use S3 for static website hosting
