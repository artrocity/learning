Availability Zones

- Each region contains multiple distinct locations (Availability Zones)
- Each availability Zone is engineered to be independent from failures in other zones
- An Availability Zone is a datacenter or multiple data centers
- Availability Zones provides inexpensive, low-latency network connection to other zones in the region
    
    - This allows you to replicate your data across data centers in a synchronous manner so that failover can be automated
