## Types of Data
- Structured
	- Data that is organized in a defined manner or schema
	- Typically found in Relational Databases
	- Characteristics
		- Easily queryable
		- Organized into rows and columns
		- Consistent Structure
	- Examples
		- CSV Files or Excel Spreadsheets with consistent columns
		- Database Tables
- Unstructured
	- Data that doesn't have a predefined schema or structure
	- Characteristics
		- Not easily queryable without structuring or preprocessing
		- Various Formats
	- Examples
		- Images
		- Emails and Word Processing Documents
		- Text Files without a fixed format
		- Videos and audio Files
- Semi-Structured
	- Data that is not as organized as structured, but has some form of structure such as tags, patterns, etc.
	- Characteristics
		- Elements are tagged in some form
		- More flexible than structured data
	- Examples
		- XML and JSON files
		- Email headers (Data, Subject, Body)
		- Log files with varied formats

## Data Properties
- Volume
	- How much data or size of the data
	- Affects decisions on how and where you store and process the data
- Velocity
	- Refers to the speed at which new data is generated, collected, and processed
	- High-velocity requires real-time or near-real-time processing
- Variety
	- Refers to the types and sources of data
	- Is it structured, unstructured, or semi-structured data

## Data Warehouses vs. Data Lakes
- Data Warehouses
	- Centralized repository where data from different sources is stored in a structured format
	- Characteristics
		- Data is cleaned, transformed and loaded
		- Designed for complex queries
		- Typically uses a star or snowflake schema
		- Optimized for read-heavy operations
	- Examples
		- Redshift
		- Google BigQuery
		- Azure SQL Data Warehouse
- Data Lake
	- Storage repo that holds casts amounts of raw data in it's native format
	- Can include structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data
	- Characteristics
		- Stores large amounts of raw data without a predefined schema
		- Data is loaded as-is, no need for preprocessing
		- Supports batch, real-time, and stream processing
		- Can be queried for data transformation or exploration purposes
	- Examples
		- S3
		- Hadoop Distributed File System

## Data Mesh
- Concerned with data governance and organization
- Each team owns their own data within a domain
- Data is used to serve the organization
- Domain-based data management
- Federated governance with central standards - everyone follows the same guidelines and standards, but can create their own content
