## AWS Deep Racer Workflow
### 1. Create a model

- Log into the AWS DeepRacer console
- Navigate to the "Your models" section
- Click "Create model" button
- Give your model a name and description
- Select a race type (time trial, object avoidance, or head-to-head racing)

### 2. Configure the model

- Choose a track for training
- Select a reinforcement learning algorithm (typically PPO - Proximal Policy Optimization)
- Define the neural network architecture (layers, nodes)
- Configure the action space:
    - Define steering angles (range and granularity)
    - Set speed values (minimum and maximum)
- Set hyperparameters:
    - Learning rate
    - Batch size
    - Number of epochs
    - Discount factor (gamma)
    - Entropy
    - Loss type

### 3. Train the model

- Define the reward function in Python (this is the crucial part that shapes the model's behavior)
- Set training time (typically 1-3 hours for beginners)
- Configure virtual car parameters (speed, steering sensitivity)
- Specify training algorithm settings
- Start the training process on AWS cloud infrastructure
- Monitor training progress through:
    - Reward graphs
    - Completion percentage
    - Crash incidents
    - Lap times

### 4. Evaluate the model

- Test the model on the same or different virtual tracks
- Review performance metrics:
    - Average lap time
    - Number of completed laps
    - Number of off-track incidents
    - Consistency of performance
- Watch simulation videos to identify specific behaviors
- Generate evaluation reports

### 5. Clone the model

- Create a copy of a promising model to preserve its state
- Make incremental improvements to the cloned model
- Compare different versions of the model using evaluation metrics
- Experiment with different reward functions or hyperparameters

### 6. Refine the model

- Adjust the reward function based on evaluation results
- Improve incentives for:
    - Staying on track
    - Following racing line
    - Maintaining appropriate speed
    - Handling curves effectively
- Increase training time for more complex behaviors
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance

### 7. Deploy the model to the car

- Download the trained model as a file
- Transfer the model to a physical AWS DeepRacer car
- Configure the physical car settings
- Test the model in a real-world track
- Calibrate the car's sensors and actuators if needed
- Make adjustments based on real-world performance
