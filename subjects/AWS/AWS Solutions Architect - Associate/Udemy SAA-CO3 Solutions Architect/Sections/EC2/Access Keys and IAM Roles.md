How do we apply permissions to EC2 Instances

- Access Keys
    
    - AWS CLI is configured with access keys
    - Access keys are generated by a specific AWS account
    - The access keys will use the permissions assigned to that IAM user
- IAM Roles
    
    - Roles have policies applied top them
    - Credentials are not stored on the EC2 instance
    - EC2 instance assumes role and accesses the resources
    - This is a more secure method than using access keys
    - AWS Roles utilizes Security Token Service(STS) in order to gain credentials
        
        - These credentials have a shorter duration that access key
        - When they're about to expire, the role will have credentials renewed via STS
- Configuring an access key to use with an EC2 instance
    
    - First, obtain an access key - this is done by:
        
        - Navigate to IAM
        - Click on user desired
        - Credentials
        - Access Key
        - CLI
        - Copy Access Key and Secret Access Key
    - Run "aws configure" on EC2 instance terminal
        
        - Enter access key
        - Enter Secret Key
        - Enter Region
- Configuring a role to work with an EC2 instance

    - Choose permissions
    - Create the role
    - Navigate to the EC2 Instances console
