- Security Concept of implementing security at multiple points in the application
- A cybersecurity strategy that employs multiple layers of security controls throughout an information system.
- Rather than relying on a single protective measure, this approach creates several barriers that an attacked would need to overcome to reach sensitive assets.
- Key Components:
    
    - Physical security - access controls, secure facilities
    - Network Security - IDS/IPS, firewalls, network segmentation
    - Host Security - OS hardening, endpoint protection
    - Application security - secure coding practicing, input validation
    - Data security - encryption
    - Admin Controls - policies, procedures, awareness training
    - Identity and access management - authentication and authorization
