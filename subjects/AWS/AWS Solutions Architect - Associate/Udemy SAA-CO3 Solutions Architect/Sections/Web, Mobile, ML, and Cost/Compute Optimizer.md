**AWS Compute Optimizer**
 
**What is it?**

- AWS Compute Optimizer is an analysis and recommendation service that helps identify optimal AWS compute resources for your workloads to reduce costs and improve performance.
 
**How does it work?**

- Compute Optimizer uses machine learning to analyze historical utilization metrics of your AWS resources. It:
    
    1. Collects and analyzes resource utilization data from CloudWatch metrics
    2. Applies machine learning models to identify patterns and resource requirements
    3. Generates recommendations for right-sizing resources based on this analysis
    4. Provides projected impact of recommendations on performance and cost
    5. Explains the reasoning behind each recommendation
- The service currently provides recommendations for EC2 instances, EBS volumes, Lambda functions, ECS services on Fargate, and Auto Scaling groups.
 
**Real World Example:**

- A media company runs various workloads on EC2 instances that were initially over-provisioned to ensure performance. After enabling Compute Optimizer, they receive recommendations showing that 40% of their instances could be downsized to different instance types, saving 25% on compute costs with no performance impact. The recommendations show exactly which instances to modify and provide projected savings for each change. Following these recommendations, the company implements an automated process to adjust resources based on Compute Optimizer findings, resulting in significant cost savings while maintaining performance.
