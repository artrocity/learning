**AWS License Manager**
 
**What is it?**

- AWS License Manager is a service that helps organizations manage their software licenses in AWS and on-premises environments. It simplifies license management for software from vendors like Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, and IBM.
 
**How does it work?**

- License Manager works by creating license rules that mirror the terms of your licensing agreements. It then:
    
    1. Tracks license usage across your AWS accounts and on-premises servers
    2. Enforces licensing rules to prevent violations (like exceeding allowed license counts)
    3. Provides inventory and usage reporting for compliance and cost optimization
    4. Automates discovery of installed software and associated licenses
    5. Centralizes license management across hybrid environments
- The service integrates with AWS services like EC2, Systems Manager, and Organizations to provide comprehensive license control and visibility.
 
**Real World Example:**

- A multinational corporation has complex Microsoft SQL Server licensing agreements that specify different rules for development versus production environments and have core-based licensing limitations. Using License Manager, they create license configurations that enforce these rules automatically. When a developer tries to launch a new SQL Server instance that would exceed their license entitlements, License Manager prevents the launch and sends an alert to the licensing team. The company's finance department also uses License Manager reports to track usage across departments for accurate chargeback and to optimize license purchases during renewal negotiations.
