AWS Account Overview

- What's required to open a new AWS account
    
    - Unique email address
    - Credit Card
    - Phone SMS Verification
- When you create an account it creates a root user
    
    - The root user logs in with the email address and password
    - The root user has full control over the account

    - Create a group
    - Assign user to the workflow
    - Grant Policies to the group
