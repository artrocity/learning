The 7 Rs of AWS Migration

- 1. Rehost ("Lift and Shift")
    
    - Moving applications to the cloud without making significant changes to architecture, functionality, or features. This involves replicating on-premises servers in the cloud.
    - Example: Migrating a CRM system from on-premises servers to EC2 instances with minimal changes.
- 2. Replatform ("Lift, Tinker, and Shift")
    
    - Making targeted optimizations to gain cloud benefits while keeping the core architecture intact.
    - Example: Moving a database from a self-managed SQL Server to Amazon RDS while maintaining the same database engine.
- 3. Repurchase ("Drop and Shop")
    
    - Switching to a different product, typically moving from a traditional license to a SaaS model.
    - Example: Replacing an on-premises HR system with Workday or transitioning from a self-hosted CRM to Salesforce.
- 4. Refactor/Re-architect
    
    - Reimagining how an application is architected and developed, typically using cloud-native features.
    - Example: Breaking a monolithic e-commerce application into microservices using containers and AWS Lambda.
- 5. Retire
    
    - Eliminating applications that are no longer needed or have been made redundant.
    - Example: Decommissioning legacy reporting systems after consolidating reporting in a cloud data warehouse.
- 6. Retain ("Revisit")
    
    - Keeping certain applications on-premises due to compliance requirements, application complexity, or pending refresh cycles.
    - Example: Keeping a specialized manufacturing system on-premises because it interfaces with physical equipment.
- 7. Relocate (Added recently)
    
    - Moving infrastructure to the cloud without purchasing new hardware, changing the underlying architecture, or modifying existing operations.
    - Example: Using VMware Cloud on AWS to move VMware-based applications without converting virtual machines.
- Each strategy offers different benefits in terms of cost, speed of migration, and level of optimization for cloud environments. Organizations typically use a mix of these strategies across their application portfolio based on business needs, technical requirements, and resource constraints.
