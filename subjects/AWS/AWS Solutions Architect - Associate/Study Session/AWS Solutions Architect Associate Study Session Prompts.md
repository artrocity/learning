## MORNING SESSION: Conceptual Framework Building

**Prompt to use each morning:**

"I'd like to build a conceptual framework for [specific AWS domain or service]. Please help me:

1. Create a decision tree for when to use this service versus alternatives
2. Map out the key integration points with other AWS services
3. Develop 2-3 scenarios to test my understanding of this framework

Today I want to focus on [specific service or concept], and I'd like to approach this through mental models rather than memorization. Guide me through creating a visual decision framework that I can use to solve problems in this area."

**Example domains to rotate through:**

- Storage services (S3, EBS, EFS, FSx)
- Compute options (EC2, Lambda, ECS, Fargate)
- Database services (RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache)
- Networking configurations (VPC, Transit Gateway, Direct Connect)
- Security services (IAM, KMS, Shield, WAF)
- Integration services (SQS, SNS, EventBridge)

## AFTERNOON SESSION: Pattern Recognition Practice

**Prompt to use each afternoon:**

"Please provide me with a complex AWS architecture scenario that incorporates multiple services. Then, guide me through:

1. Identifying the core architectural patterns used in this solution
2. Analyzing why these patterns were selected for this specific business case
3. Exploring how I could apply these same patterns to solve a different business problem

I want to strengthen my pattern recognition abilities so I can quickly identify solution approaches on the exam. Present the scenario first, then help me analyze it systematically using high-order thinking rather than service-level memorization."

**Example focus areas to rotate through:**

- High availability and disaster recovery patterns
- Microservice architecture patterns
- Serverless application patterns
- Data lake and analytics patterns
- Hybrid connectivity patterns
- Multi-region deployment patterns

## EVENING SESSION: Integration and Synthesis

**Prompt to use each evening:**

"Based on what I've learned today about [mention morning topic] and [mention afternoon pattern], help me:

1. Connect these concepts to my broader AWS knowledge
2. Identify 3-5 key relationships between today's topics and previously learned AWS concepts
3. Create a visual representation that shows how today's learning fits into the bigger picture
4. Develop 2-3 practice questions that test my ability to synthesize this knowledge

I want to ensure I'm building integrated knowledge rather than isolated facts. Guide me through creating connections between concepts and strengthening my mental model of AWS architecture as a whole."

**Synthesis approaches to rotate through:**

- Mapping concepts to Well-Architected Framework pillars
- Creating service relationship maps
- Developing solution comparison matrices
- Building scenario-based decision frameworks
- Creating architectural pattern libraries
- Mapping concepts to common exam question types
