This guide explains how to get the most from each study session when using the provided prompts. It provides detailed instructions on how to engage with each prompt and maximize the benefits of high-order learning.

## How to Use the Morning Session Effectively

### Before Starting

- Select a specific AWS service or domain you want to focus on
- Have a blank sheet of paper or digital canvas ready for your framework
- Set a timer for 45 minutes (15 min per activity)

### During the Session

1. **Framework Development (15 min)**
    
    - When prompted, focus on creating a _visual_ decision tree
    - Use questions rather than statements at each decision point
    - Think about the "why" behind each branch
    - Use colors to distinguish different types of decision factors
2. **Framework Application (15 min)**
    
    - When given scenarios, apply your framework step by step
    - Verbalize your reasoning at each decision point
    - Note any areas where your framework seems incomplete
    - Refine your framework based on these insights
3. **Framework Connection (15 min)**
    
    - Actively identify how this framework connects to other AWS domains
    - Create at least three bridge concepts that link to other areas
    - Think about when this framework might break down or need modification

### High-Order Learning Techniques to Apply

- **Categorization:** Group decision factors by theme (cost, performance, security)
- **Hierarchical Organization:** Establish priority order for decision factors
- **Comparative Analysis:** At each branch, articulate why one path versus another
- **Abstraction:** Focus on principles rather than specific feature details

## How to Use the Afternoon Session Effectively

### Before Starting

- Have a method ready to visualize architectures (drawing tool or paper)
- Set a timer for 45 minutes (15 min per activity)
- Prepare to think aloud as you analyze the scenario

### During the Session

1. **Pattern Identification (15 min)**
    
    - When presented with a scenario, first identify the business requirements
    - Map components of the architecture to specific patterns
    - Name these patterns and describe their key characteristics
    - Look for nested patterns within the larger architecture
2. **Pattern Analysis (15 min)**
    
    - For each identified pattern, analyze why it was chosen
    - Connect design choices to business requirements
    - Identify the trade-offs made in selecting these patterns
    - Consider what alternative patterns could have been used
3. **Pattern Transfer (15 min)**
    
    - Take each core pattern and apply it to a completely different business context
    - Adapt the pattern as needed for the new context
    - Identify what aspects remain constant and what needs to change
    - Consider how patterns can be combined differently

### High-Order Learning Techniques to Apply

- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify recurring structural elements in the solution
- **Extrapolation:** Extend patterns to new contexts
- **Synthesis:** Combine multiple patterns into cohesive solutions
- **Evaluation:** Assess the strengths and weaknesses of different patterns

## How to Use the Evening Session Effectively

### Before Starting

- Review notes from your morning and afternoon sessions
- Prepare a larger knowledge map or canvas where you can add today's concepts
- Set a timer for 45 minutes (15 min per activity)

### During the Session

1. **Knowledge Connection (15 min)**
    
    - Actively draw connections between today's topics and previous knowledge
    - Create a visual representation of these connections
    - Label the nature of each connection (enables, replaces, complements, etc.)
    - Identify any contradictions or tensions between concepts
2. **Knowledge Map Expansion (15 min)**
    
    - Add today's concepts to your growing knowledge map
    - Reorganize elements as needed to maintain conceptual clarity
    - Identify emerging themes or patterns in your knowledge structure
    - Consider different ways to organize the same information
3. **Knowledge Testing (15 min)**
    
    - Engage with the practice questions provided
    - Think through your reasoning for each answer
    - Identify which concepts from your knowledge map you're applying
    - Create your own questions that bridge multiple knowledge areas

### High-Order Learning Techniques to Apply

- **Integration:** Connect new information to existing knowledge structures
- **Elaboration:** Expand concepts by adding details and relationships
- **Metacognition:** Reflect on your understanding and identify knowledge gaps
- **Application:** Apply combined knowledge to solve complex problems

## Maximizing Visual Learning

For all sessions, emphasize visual representation of knowledge:

1. **Use Spatial Arrangement**
    
    - Position related concepts near each other
    - Use distance to represent conceptual distance
    - Create clusters for highly related concepts
2. **Use Visual Hierarchy**
    
    - Make more important elements larger or more central
    - Use levels or layers to show hierarchical relationships
    - Use visual containment to show categorization
3. **Use Color Strategically**
    
    - Assign colors to different AWS categories
    - Use color intensity to show importance
    - Use color coding consistently across all your materials
4. **Use Connecting Lines with Meaning**
    
    - Label connections between concepts
    - Use different line styles for different types of relationships
    - Use arrows to show direction of influence or dependency

## Tracking Progress

Keep a learning journal that records:

1. **Conceptual Frameworks Developed**
    
    - Date created
    - Core concept
    - Key decision points
    - Refinements made over time
2. **Patterns Recognized**
    
    - Pattern name
    - Key characteristics
    - AWS services involved
    - Business problems it solves
3. **Knowledge Connections**
    
    - New connections discovered
    - Insights from these connections
    - Questions raised
    - Areas for further exploration

This progressive documentation will reveal your growing mental model and help identify areas that need further development.
