# Evolution of AI 
AI and Cybersecurity's evolution
- AI helps organizations stay ahead of the curve for detecting threats
- AI is being used for advanced threat detection and automated response
- AI is allowing the shift from reactive to proactive security stance
- This is dynamically lowering the Mean-Time-To Response

# Leveraging AI
Leveraging AI for proactivity
- Predicting attack patterns
- Automating responses
	- Using AI to automatically respond to lower level threats in order to free up more time for your security engineers and respond to incidents sooner
- Processing large security datasets
	- GenAI excels at analyzing large datasets, this allows faster threat detection.

# Why Do We Need AI
Why do security professionals need AI
- Automating routine tasks
	- AI can handle monitoring and responding to security threats
	- Manage system updates
	- Allow you to focus on vulnerability analysis
- Frees up security teams
	- By automating routine tasks, security professionals can focus on complex high-value work
- Skills for AI in cybersecurity
	- Security professionals need a solid understanding of AI models and skills to interpret AI insights effectively. 
	- This includes knowledge of machine learning and the ability to analyze AI-generated results

# How Does AI Enhance Security
Faster threat detection
- AI enables rapid processing of data, preventing attacks before they escalate
Insider threat alerts
- AI can monitor employee behavior patterns and flag suspicious activity
Automated incident responses
- AI streamlines incident response, reduce mean time to response and containment time

# Challenges in AI and Cybersecurity
- Data privacy Concerns
	- AI requires vast dats, organizations must adhere to strict regulations to protect sensitive data
- Security of AI Models
	- AI models are vulnerable to manipulation by attackers.
- Ethical concerns in AI-driven decisions
	- Avoid biases

# AWS Services
Amazon BedRock
- Allows organizations to create custom security models for unique threats
- Common questions
	- Which model should I use
	- How can I move quickly
	- How can I keep my data secure and private
- Managed service
	- Allows the choice of leading FMs through a single API
	- Model customization
	- Retrieval Augmented Generation
		- Retrieval
			- User asks a question
			- System searches through a knowledge base (docs, database, etc)
		- Augmentation
			- Retrieved information is then added to the prompt sent by LLM
		- Generation
			- LLM provides a response that's grounded in the retrieved information
	- Agents that execute multistep tasks
	- Security, Privacy, and data governance

Amazon Bedrock Model Choices:
