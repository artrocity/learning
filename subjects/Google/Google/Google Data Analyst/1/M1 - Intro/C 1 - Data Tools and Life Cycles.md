**Data Life Cycle**

- Plan
    
    - Decide what kind of data is required
    - Who is responsible for the data
- Capture
    
    - Collected from a variety of sources
        
        - Outside resources
        - Companies documents and files
        - Scraping
- Manage
    
    - How is our data stored
    - Tools to keep it secured
    - Maintain the data
- Analyze
    
    - Data is used to solve problems
    - Support Decisions
- Archive
    
    - Storing data in a place that's available but may not be used again
- Destroy
    
    - Use a secure data eraser software
    - Shred files
 
**The phases of the data analysis**

- Ask
    
    - Define the problem to be solved
    - What are we looking to gain or learn from this analysis?
    - What type of data do we need?
    - Look at the current state and see how it is different from the ideal state
    - Understand the needs of the stakeholders
    - The "5 Whys" are essential here
- Prepare
    
    - Collect and store data
    - What type of Data
    - Where are we going to get this data
    - Does the data already exist or do we need to obtain it
- Process
    
    - Cleaning Data
    - Find and eliminate errors and inaccuracies
    - Remove missing data
    - Transform Data
    - Remove outliers
- Analyze
    
    - Run through the pre-planned analysis
    - Remove any bias, take a step back and tell the story of the data
    - Use tools to transform and organize data
    - Helps you make informed decision making
    - There are tools that you can use
        
        - SQL
        - Spreadsheets
- Share
    
    - Describe the data from a high level perspective and slowly move down to a more detailed approach
    - How do we help stakeholders make effective decisions
    - Use data visualizations
- Act
    
    - Put findings to work to solve the original issue
- Evaluate
    
    - How did the changes affect the original issue
 
**Data Analysis Tools**

- Spreadsheets
    
    - Excel
    - Google Sheets
    - Spreadsheets contain Formulas and Functions
        
        - Formulas are a set of instructions that perform a specific calculation using the data in a spreadsheet
        - Functions are a preset command that automatically perform a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet
- Query Languages
    
    - Computer programming language that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data
    - SQL is the most widely used structured query language
- Visualization Tools
    
    - Graphical representation of data
    - Tableau
        
        - Drag and drop features, lets you create interactive graphs in dashboards and worksheets
    - Looker
        
        - Communicates directly with the database, allowing you to connect your data to the right visual tool you choose
    - Power BI
        
        - Similar to Tableau
- Programming Languages
    
    - Allowing you to write programs to:
        
        - Scrape Data
        - Visualize Data
        - Parse Data
        - Clean / Scrub Data
        - Create statistical analysis
