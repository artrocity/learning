What if you need to give access rights to a compute engine virtual machine rather than a person
 
Service Accounts

- Allows you to assign specific services to a virtual machine etc
- Named with an email address
- Use cryptographic keys to access resources
- Service accounts DO NEED TO BE MANAGED
- Service Accounts are a resource so they can have IAM Roles attached to them
