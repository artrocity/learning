Infrastructure as a Service

- Allows you to share compute resources using VMs by virtualizing the hardware using virtual machines
 
Containers

- Give the independent workload scalability in PaaS
- Give the OS and Hardware Abstraction layer in IaaS
- Invisible box around the code and its dependencies
- Limited access to its own partition of the file system and hardware
- Requires:
    
    - Few system calls to create and starts as quickly as a process
    - OS Kernel that supports containers and a container runtime on each host
- Scales like PaaS but has the flexibility of IaaS
